                <h1>History of Halloween</h1>
                <p>Halloween began as the festival of Samhain. It was part of the ancient Celtic religion in Britain and other parts of Europe.

                    At the end of summer, the Celts thought the barrier between our world and the world of ghosts and spirits got really thin.
                    
                    This meant weird creatures with strange powers could wander about on Earth.
                    
                    The Celts had a big party. It was all about scaring away the ghosts and spirits.
                    
                    Later, with the Christian religion, the day became known as All Hallows' Eve - the day before All Saints' Day on 1 November.

                    It's in America that Halloween has really taken off.
                    
                    Irish immigrants to the United States raised the popularity of Halloween during the 19th century.
                    
                    During the 20th century it became more and more popular, with traditions like pumpkin carving and trick or treating becoming part of TV shows, books and movies.

                    Most scholars agree that Halloween as we know it started some 2,000 years ago when Celtic people in Europe celebrated the end of the harvest and the start of a new year in a festival called Samhain (pronounced "sow-win"). It was also a time of communing with otherworldly spirits, with big bonfires lit in honor of the dead, according to The American Folklife Center. 

                    In addition to honoring the dead, the Celts also believed that the spiritual presence on Samhain made it easier for Celtic priests to predict the future, according to History. They'd build bonfires and burn crops and animals as sacrifices to the Celtic gods. Villagers would attend the bonfire wearing costumes of animal heads and skins.

        <h1>What Happens On Halloween Night</h1>
        <p>Halloween, celebrated annually on October 31, is one of the world’s oldest holidays. Although it's derived from ancient festivals and religious rituals,  Halloween is still widely celebrated today in a number of countries around the globe. In countries such as Ireland, Canada and the United States, traditions include costume parties, trick-or-treating, pranks and games. Versions of the holiday are celebrated elsewhere, too. In Mexico and other Latin American countries, Día de los Muertos—the Day of the Dead—honors deceased loved ones and ancestors. In England, Guy Fawkes Day, which falls on November 5, is commemorated with bonfires and fireworks</p>
